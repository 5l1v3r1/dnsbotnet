DNSBotnet
=========
Controller for a DNS Botnet.  Work in progress, though works pretty well as-is.

More documentation (and ease-of-use) will be implemented in the future.

For legal use only.

Building
--------
In the two directories with go source, `go build` works nicely.  The implant
has a convenient `build.sh`.
